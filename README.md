## Note on auto build

The [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/yegle/fava) was switched
from build by Docker Hub to Github Actions. The image label pattern is
changed: instead of labeled `version-1.xx` it's now labeled `v1.xx`.

You can check the auto build logs at https://github.com/yegle/fava-docker/actions.
